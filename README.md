# Hi there, I'm Renee

**CS Student @ UC San Diego | Gen AI & Cloud Engineering Enthusiast**

## About Me

I'm a computer science student passionate about building intelligent systems that bridge AI and cloud infrastructure. With hands-on experience in agentic AI workflows, RAG pipelines, and enterprise cloud integrations, I enjoy solving complex problems at the intersection of machine learning and scalable system design.

I've worked on AI-driven resume intelligence platforms, enterprise cloud integrations with Oracle and Azure, and built autonomous coding agents that generate full applications from natural language prompts. When I'm not coding, I'm exploring new ML algorithms or mentoring fellow students in programming.
